\textbf{{Some Topics in Linear Algebra to be reviewed for NLA 1}}\\
\thispagestyle{empty}


- Vector Spaces: definitions, subspaces, linear independence, basis, dimension.

- Linear Maps: definitions, range and null space (image and kernel), invertibility, matrix representation of a linear map.

- Matrices: matrix-vector and matrix-matrix multiplication. Interpretation as a linear combination of the columns of the matrix. Column space and null space of a matrix. Rank-nullity theorem. Transpose of a matrix.

- Operations with elementary matrices: switching two rows, scaling a Row, adding a multiple of a row to another. Deleting rows.

- Matrices and linear systems: 
$Ax=b$ has a solution if $b$ lies in the column space of $A$.
$Ax=b$ can have exactly one, infinitely many, or no solutions.
Invertibility (equivalences), determinant of a matrix.

- Eigenvalues and eigenvectors: 
definitions and how to compute them. When is a matrix diagonalizable.

- Inner products and norms: definitions, norms in $\mathbb{C}^n$, orthogonality, Gram-schmidt procedure. Unitary, normal, positive matrices.

- Matrix decompositions:
